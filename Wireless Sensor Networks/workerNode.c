/*

Code that runs on the sensor nodes located on the helmets of the workers.

BLOCK DIAGRAM:

1. Get Sensor Readings
2. Check if dangerous levels have been reached and perform appropriate actions (e.g. beep a buzzer)
3. Report readings back to base station along with safety status of the workers
4. Repeat


IMPORTANT:

Emergency button should probably be implemented as an interrupt (if possible) to
immediately interrupt any time-consuming running tasks.
